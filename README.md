<h2>FootballData</h2>
<p>A scraper for football data and potential prediction of future fantasy points.</p>
<h3>Problem</h3>
<p>Currently there are sites that track game by game statistics for each player. However this is very high level and doesn't carry through beyond that. For instance, we can't predict the fantasy points for a player for the upcoming week. The stats don't take into account contextual information. FootballData will try to solve some of these issues.</p>
